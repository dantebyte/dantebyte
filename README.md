## 📚 About Me

Hi, I’m Dante — an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a hands-on approach to ethical hacking, network defense, and digital forensics. My focus spans malware analysis, payload development, OSINT, darknet reconnaissance, and the growing risk posed by botnets and compromised IoT devices.

While I’m not a formal SOC analyst, I’ve trained myself to detect suspicious activity, study attacker behavior, and respond to potential threats using open-source tools and real-world scenarios. I learn fast — give me a new tool, language, or concept, and I’ll get to work, adapt, and make it happen. I might not be building custom malware or frameworks from scratch, but I know how to break things down, solve problems, and get results.

This portfolio includes personal projects, research notes, and the tools I've used to understand and simulate modern cyber threats. It’s a reflection of my curiosity, discipline, and growth in the field.

🧰 Skills & Areas of Focus:
Payload analysis and malware behavior

Botnet mapping and infected IoT device research

Social engineering tactics & phishing defense

OSINT and darknet threat recon

Basic detection workflows and IOC tracking

Recon and reporting for larger enterprise environments

Building functional tools/scripts in Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

Quickly picking up and applying new tools or frameworks

🛠️ Tools I Work With:
Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, Shodan

Metasploit, OSINT Frameworks, VirusTotal

Python scripting for automation and analysis

GitHub for documentation, version control, and project collaboration

Browser-based tools and cloud platforms for recon and testing
